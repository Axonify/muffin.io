Ideas:
- package management via Bower
- source map support
- ioSync support
- a JavaScript error log service
- an admin console like the one for Google App Engine
- fix 20% cpu usage when idle
- muffin test
- a better way to manage reusable apps
- build more reusable apps: flatpages, admin, geo
- Jeckyll style static site generator using JSON files
- Generate the admin site similar to WordPress or Django
- Easily apply themes to the site, similar to WordPress
- muffin.io website (show off interactive features, promotional video, good documentation, prezi, host on Nodejitsu)
- Sublime Text 2 plugin
- A web interface as an alternative to using commands that supports creating a new project, choose project type (mobile, static, desktop), and change themes.
- Eventually, the web interface might trump the command line interface. At that point we can do all the work in the browser, from creating a project, to coding, to deployment. Muffin will become a cloud service to easily create interactive webapps. (Imagine saving code in one browser window, and the other browser window auto reloads the page.)
- Integrate with iPython. Supports advanced scientific computing functionalities.
